 ## Steganography 

This code uses Python to hide a message inside an image using steganography. 

### Step-by-step explanation

Before using the application, ensure that the `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) library is installed. If it's not installed, you can install it using the following command:

```
pip install pillow
```

First, we import the `Message` class from the `secret` module. 

```python
from secret import Message
```

Next, we create a `Message` object, passing in the path to the image we want to use.

```python
message = Message("image.jpg")  # path of image
```

We can then use the `write()` method to write a message to the image. The message will be converted to bytes before being written to the image.

```python
message.write("Hidden Leaf")  
```

The `read()` method can be used to read the message from the image. The message will be returned as a string.

```python
message.read()
```

Finally, the `ReSeT()` method can be used to remove the message from the image.

### Conclusion

This code provides a simple example of how to use steganography to hide a message inside an image.

## Notes

- Writing this message does not harm the jpg file.
- It only works on images in jpg format.
